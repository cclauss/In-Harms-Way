Idea for a Mobile Locator / Rescue App - Looking for interest

Have a topic below that may be of interest as it pertains to smarter planet, emergency / disaster response. 

__Subject: Proposal for an Emergency Mobile App for locating missing/injured hiker and supporting rescue operations__

Been on several woods / trail rescues this year on the Appalachian Trail and the most recent one being about a week or so ago at dusk.  Recognize that there are pinning applications out there for mobile phones using GPS....but really see an opportunity to develop / offer up an app that is designed specifically for this type of incident management. 

The idea is to have an Injured Hiker or Woods Rescue APP that would enable an incident commander to either tie in to a person via cell phone or by inserting longitude/latitude coordinates, or mobile phone number, and with the incorporation of trail and roadway maps, and using GPS, be able to show on a hand held device, 1: the lost or injured hiker, 2; the incident command post coordinating the rescue, 3: the rescue party or parties... against a backdrop of a detailed local map (like Google maps, etc).  

With maps of hiking trails and local highway and satellite imagery, topography, compass headings, and long/lat, we could see the locations and headings of all parties involved. 

Most times, county 911 dispatchers will attempt to use cell services to try to triangulate the location of the hiker based on the nearest cell tower locations, but as we have seen in the last 4 or 5 searches, that this is pretty inaccurate.

What might also be helpful is having the topographic elevations on the maps to prepare rescuers on what to expect as well as to help determine the optimal exit route.   The last incident we had started at 7PM, rescue party entered the woods at approx 7:30PM, had difficulty locating, managing in the dark, and reached the patient at 10PM.  Another rescue party entered the woods, again dealing with difficult terrain and darkness.   They all met up and were able to exit the woods at 2AM.   The hiker had a broken ankle.  If we had a working application like this, it would have accelerated the entire incident, optimized resources, and got the patient to the hospital much sooner.  It also would have reduced the resources needed and also reduced the need for rehab for the rescue parties.

Other ideas for features include an ability for a lost/injured person to trigger the app to send out an emergency / responder beacon that could hit your phone and would give out signalsâ€¦similar to a plane going down.

You guys are thinking just like me...  At Altitude is an mobile app that I can turn on when I am going into dangerous locations (for me, ski touring in the winter and mountain biking in the summer).  The system should be flexible enough to treat dangerous occupation environments and natural disaster areas in a similar but different manner.  The system keeps a rolling track of my last known locations and if the mobile app detects a critsit (sudden fall, sudden shock, significant, sudden temperature change, etc.) or if I hit the panic button, the At Altitude server will create an ad hoc social network around me to notify proximate rescue worker (geofencing) and alert my friend network.  It would be great help to the project if you would be willing to get involved to write up a user story based on your note above.

Hi Christian,

Really appreciate your insights and input.  I am in an IBM training class this week so I apologize for the delay in replying.  I did speak to Manny Fusco today and we will collaborate to come up with a draft user story which we will share.
