#Injured Hiker User Story for Emergency Mobile Locator
###Submitted by Michael King and Manuel Fusco to Christian Clauss July 17, 2015

##Dependencies & Assumptions
* Target party is a person or persons in need of immediate help
* Both the Target party and Rescue Party have a mobile device containing App

##User Stories
1. As a first responder, I wish to quickly pinpoint the position of a target party that is located somewhere within a remote, inaccessible, or treacherous physical environment.
	__Discussion:__

2. As a first responder I wish to be able to visualize the location of the target party on a mobile device.
	__Discussion:__ Mobile device provide portability

3. As a first responder I wish to be able to see the location of the target party and rescue party against a topographical map containing nearby hiking trails, roads, local highways, elevations, altitudes, compass headings, longitude / latitude, satellite imagery.
	__Discussion:__ Visualizing the parties against a backdrop of a topographical map complete with the prescribed features, the rescue party can effectively plan and coordinate a path for access and egress.  This will prepare rescuers on what to expect as well as determine optimal exit route.
â€‹
4. As a first responder I wish to be able to see the location of the target party and the proximity of the target to the rescue party(s), the incident commander, and / or other necessary resources.
	__Discussion:__ Seeing the location of involved parties, we can determine correct headings and target intersect.

5. As a first responder I wish to be able to visually see the track of the target party and rescue party from the time of initial activation of the mobile app, the commencement of the rescue operations, until target party and all rescue resources are returned to a safe environment.
	__Discussion:__  System keeps a rolling track of last known locations.  The application would enable acceleration of the entire incident response, enable resource optimization, and get the target party to safety or to a medical facility much sooner.  It would also reduce the resources needed and help to minimize the rehabilitation of rescue workers involved.

6. As a first responder I wish to be able to open on demand voice communications to a specific target party member or specific rescue party member, or activate a blanket communication broadcast transmission to all parties.
	__Discussion:__  Locator app combined with an on demand communications feature would optimise efficiency and conserve power.

7. As a potential target party, I wish to have an app  that I can manually trigger or that can automatically engage and will send out an emergency / responder beacon to facilitate a rescue.
	__Discussion:__

8. As a potential target party, I wish to have an app that I can monitor critical broadcasts within my person/proximity and automatically trigger the locator app.
	__Discussion:__ Having the utility to monitor for Tsunami warnings, severe weather, flood warnings, storm broadcasts, earthquake / Seismic warnings, flood, warzone, political unrest, etc., and provide the ability proactively alert the potential target party and suggest manual activation or automatically trigger the application could be a great benefit as timing is everything in a disaster situation.  Consider an avalanche beacon that signals the app and triggers the locator automatically would speed search and rescue operations.
