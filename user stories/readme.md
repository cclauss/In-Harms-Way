Collaborative agile software development requires great __user stories__ to create a shared common understanding of what is to be built and how users will interact with the system.  Once consensus has been established on  the validity of these user stories then requirements and test cases can be extracted from them and design and development can begin.

At Altitude is intended to provide assistance to users in a wide variety of dangerous environments from natural disasters to mountain sports to minerals and mining.  Given the large differences in the context and constraints of these environments, we are creating a series of user stories to ensure that the system is flexible enough to correctly respond to user needs.
